## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Django and Django REST Framework

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NzeStan/django-testimonials.git
   cd django-testimonials
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/NzeStan/django-testimonials.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. Set up the test database:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest --create-db
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. Keep your branch up to date:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

### Development Guidelines

- Follow Django best practices
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Update documentation when necessary
- Add tests for new functionality

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=testimonials --cov-report=html
```

Run specific tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_models.py
pytest tests/test_api.py::TestTestimonialAPI::test_create_testimonial
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Tests should be fast and reliable

### Test Structure

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py          # Test Django settings
â”œâ”€â”€ test_models.py       # Model tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_api.py         # API endpoint tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_admin.py       # Admin interface tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_signals.py     # Signal tests
â””â”€â”€ factories.py        # Factory Boy factories
```

## Code Style

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

### Formatting and Linting

- **Black**: Code formatting (line length: 88)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter

Run formatting:
```bash
black .
isort .
```

Run linting:
```bash
ruff check .
```

### Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to public methods and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Optional
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


class Testimonial(models.Model):
    """A customer testimonial with rating and approval status."""
    
    author_name: str = models.CharField(
        _("Author Name"),
        max_length=100,
        help_text=_("Name of the person giving the testimonial")
    )
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Testimonial by {self.author_name}"
    
    def get_absolute_url(self) -> str:
        """Return the canonical URL for this testimonial."""
        return reverse("testimonials:detail", kwargs={"pk": self.pk})
```
